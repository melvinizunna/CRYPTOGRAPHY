# CRYPTOGRAPHY
-A CYBERSECURITY PROJECT
- In this project, I will focus on cryptography to secure sensitive information such as credit card numbers, PINs, bank account numbers, and private messages. With the increasing use of the Internet for business and personal communication, protecting this data is becoming more critical and challenging. Cryptography and cryptographic systems help secure data from interception and compromise during online transmissions, protecting confidential data like email messages, chat sessions, web transactions, and personal information.

As an ethical hacker or penetration tester, I will recommend proper encryption techniques to protect data both in storage and during transmission. 

The objective of this project is to use encryption to conceal data and perform tasks such as:

    Generating hashes and checksums for files.
    Calculating the encrypted value of selected files.
    Using encryption and decryption techniques.
    Performing file and data encryption.
    Creating self-signed certificates.
    Performing email encryption.
    Performing disk encryption.
    Conducting cryptanalysis.

     The labs will cover the following tasks:

    Encrypt Information Using Various Cryptography Tools:
        HashCalc: Calculate one-way hashes.
        MD5 Calculator: Calculate MD5 hashes.
        HashMyFiles: Calculate MD5 hashes.
        CryptoForge: Perform file and text message encryption.
        BCTextEncoder: Encrypt and decrypt data.

    Create Self-Signed Certificates:
        Self-Signed Certificates: Create and use self-signed certificates.

    Perform Email Encryption:
        RMail: Perform email encryption.

    Perform Disk Encryption:
        VeraCrypt: Perform disk encryption.
        BitLocker Drive Encryption: Perform disk encryption.
        Rohos Disk Encryption: Perform disk encryption.

    Perform Cryptanalysis Using Various Cryptanalysis Tools:
        CrypTool: Perform cryptanalysis.
        AlphaPeeler: Perform cryptanalysis.

  It is important to note that all activities were ethically and within legal boundaries.
